# Sample-BookStore-Database

A bookstore database is a computerized system used to store and manage the 
inventory and sales of a bookstore. It typically includes information about each book, 
such as its title, author, publisher, and number of Pages, as well as details about the 
bookstore's customers and orders. The database may also store information about the 
Authors themselves and their Details. The database is used to track the inventory and 
sales of the bookstore, as well as to generate reports and analyze data to help the 
bookstore make informed business decisions such as knowing each customer favorite 
type of books. It may be accessed through a desktop computer or a web-based 
interface, and can be updated in real-time as sales are made and new books are added 
to the inventory.
I have created three collections in the bookstore database: "Authors," "Books," and 
"Customers." Each of these collections contains five documents, with two of the 
documents in each collection containing nested documents.
• The "Authors" collection includes information about each author, such as their 
name, biographical details, and a Count of their published books.
• The "books" collection contains information about each book, such as its title, 
author, publisher, and Number of Pages, as well as a list of reviews and ratings 
from customers.
• The "customers" collection includes information about each customer, such as 
their name, contact information, and a list of the books they have purchased. By 
organizing the data in this way, it is easy to quickly retrieve and analyze the 
information in the bookstore database.
